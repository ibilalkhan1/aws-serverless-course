## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the hands-on practical activity for the **Serverless Computing on AWS** course.  
It demonstrates the core **AWS Serverless Services** through **simulated CLI execution** on macOS.

Because an AWS account with active credentials was not available, all commands were **replicated locally** using the AWS CLI to **simulate outputs** of real AWS resources.
